This was a task that I was assigned to do in my "Object Oriented programming" class in Sofia University

The whole idea is centered around the project is to:
	- create new cards from the "Magic the Gathering" franchise
	- create new decks from cards
	- create players and assing decks to them

I have created the program with the idea to load databases for cards, decks and players from file
You can even output selected player information to a file
